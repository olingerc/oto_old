#Features
continue developing resource like in delete user in admin controller
put title attribute of current sort on sort button, maybve change icon
stack slug in url for better browser history --> https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/master/sample/states.js
allow easy addition of admin user via commandline
small link label under thumbs
do I really need to change the Marshaller for attachments? It works for stack with referencefield user
use g object to get user at every request.
recheck the cookie things, currently I hack the response into actionable json in the authentication service.How about a remember me option?

#Bugs
-Client
watchlist: Allow only one object in collection with same series name. indexOf not good for new search with same name

-Server

-Both

#Framework questions
do I need an archive stack like the floating stack?
can I set required = False for stackid and set stackid = null in archive? Since that particular id no longer exists if corresponding stack is deleted
to slash or not to slash: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-to-make-a-trailing-slash-optional-for-all-routes

#Last thing worked on:
Test cookie a bit further and then think about how to redo iphone UI
