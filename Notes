How to modify view after delete/update?
Instead or relaying on the $index - which - as you have noticed - will point to the index in a sorted / filtered array, you can pass the item itself to your removeItem function:

<a><img src="img/delete.png" ng-click="removeItem(item)">{{$index}}</a>
and modify the removeItem function to find an index using the indexOf method of an array as follows:

$scope.removeItem = function(item){
   $scope.items.splice($scope.items.indexOf(item),1);
}
