#Features
continue developing resource like in delete user in admin controller
put title attribute of current sort on sort button, maybve change icon
directive for porgress thumb to make it nicer, maybe jquery knob? or bootstrap progress
stack slug in url for better browser history --> https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/master/sample/states.js
allow easy addition of admin user via commandline
small link label under thumbs
do I really need to change the Marshaller for attachments? It works for stack with referencefield user
use g object to get user at every request.
recheck the cookie things, currently I hack the response into actionable json in the authentication service.How about a remember me option?

#Bugs
-Client

-Server
if no floating stack, it is created but not there yet. error for missing id. reload solves it

-Both

#Framework questions
do I need an archive stack like the floating stack?
can I set required = False for stackid and set stackid = null in archive? Since that particular id no longer exists if corresponding stack is deleted
to slash or not to slash: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-to-make-a-trailing-slash-optional-for-all-routes

#Last thing worked on:
Authentication with remember me
