#Features
continue developing resource like in delete user in admin controller
https://github.com/witoldsz/angular-http-auth
put title attribute of current sort on sort button, maybve change icon

#Bugs
Add link  in new card and then cancellin gcauses 404 of urlattachment. but its deleted!
if no floating stack, it is created but not there yet. error for missing id. reload solves it
xng-focus with ng-show
uploading big files crashes server in save to mongo
do I really need to change the Marshaller for attachments? It works for stack with referencefield user
use g object to get user at every request.

#Framework questions
do I need an archive stack like the floating stack?
can I set required = False for stackid and set stackid = null in archive? Since that particular id no longer exists if corresponding stack is deleted

#Last thing worked on:
Check TODOs




at the end of layout.html:
     // Partial views... Load up front to make transitions smoother
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="404")
            include partials/404
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="admin")
            include partials/admin
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="home")
            include partials/home
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="login")
            include partials/login
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="private")
            include partials/private
