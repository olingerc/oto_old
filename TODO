#Features
continue developing resource like in delete user in admin controller
https://github.com/witoldsz/angular-http-auth
put title attribute of current sort on sort button, maybve change icon
directive for porgress thumb to make it nicer, maybe jquery knob? or bootstrap progress
more action buttons instead of dropdown for faster access to freqeuntly used actions
stack slug in url for better browser history --> https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/master/sample/states.js
allow easy addition of admin user via commandline

#Bugs
Better mimetype image recogniation. I think iso files also have image in the mimetype
Time discrepancy server/client
Add link  in new card and then cancellin gcauses 404 of urlattachment. but its deleted! The server only tries twice?!
if no floating stack, it is created but not there yet. error for missing id. reload solves it
do I really need to change the Marshaller for attachments? It works for stack with referencefield user
use g object to get user at every request.
recheck the cookie things, currently I hack the response into actionable json in the authentication service.How about a remember me option?

#Framework questions
do I need an archive stack like the floating stack?
can I set required = False for stackid and set stackid = null in archive? Since that particular id no longer exists if corresponding stack is deleted

#Last thing worked on:
404 URL attachmetn




at the end of layout.html:
     // Partial views... Load up front to make transitions smoother
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="404")
            include partials/404
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="admin")
            include partials/admin
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="home")
            include partials/home
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="login")
            include partials/login
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="private")
            include partials/private
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="register")
            include partials/register
