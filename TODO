#Features

https://github.com/witoldsz/angular-http-auth
put title attribute of current sort on sort button, maybve change icon
directive for porgress thumb to make it nicer, maybe jquery knob? or bootstrap progress
stack slug in url for better browser history --> https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/master/sample/states.js
allow easy addition of admin user via commandline
small link label under thumbs

#Bugs
file uploads no longer working since modal. does fileupload survive modal close?
set dates on new for correct sorting until card returns from server
calendar butoon not workng for duedate
compare to original card for ok disable not working
if no floating stack, it is created but not there yet. error for missing id. reload solves it
do I really need to change the Marshaller for attachments? It works for stack with referencefield user
use g object to get user at every request.
recheck the cookie things, currently I hack the response into actionable json in the authentication service.How about a remember me option?

#Framework questions
do I need an archive stack like the floating stack?
can I set required = False for stackid and set stackid = null in archive? Since that particular id no longer exists if corresponding stack is deleted

#Last thing worked on:
cardform as modal




at the end of layout.html:
     // Partial views... Load up front to make transitions smoother
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="404")
            include partials/404
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="admin")
            include partials/admin
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="home")
            include partials/home
        script(type="text/ng-template", id="login")
            include partials/login
