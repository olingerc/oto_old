#Bugs
prevent edit of cards still in progress or waiting to be saved
some bugs still in thumb progress image display in cardform and cardlist
empty cardformcard scope on cancel
if no floating stack, it is created but not there yet. error for missing id. reload solves it
acrchiving a note keeps action button active
xng-focus with ng-show
long thumblist margin errors in card and cardfom
uploading big files crashes server in save to mongo
multiple file upload thumbs only visible after last has uploaded
no primitive values for scope, use objects to prevent parent scope shadowing
do I really need to change the Marshaller for attachments? It works for stack with referencefield user
use g object to get user at every request.

#Framework questions
do I need an archive stack like the floating stack?
can I set required = False for stackid and set stackid = null in archive? Since that particular id no longer exists if corresponding stack is deleted

#Last thing worked on:
uploading files and links

        script(type="text/ng-template", id="admin")
